How to deploy, run and maintain TicTacToe.

This should work on any system using Java JRE 8.

A downloadable zip file containing the binary is available at [Joel&TheJuice github](https://github.com/JoelandtheJuice/TicTacToe/archive/master.zip).

###Server deployment###

Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder and execute the `run` file. You will have to do `chmod +x run` to make the command file executable on some systems. Choose port for the web server, or use default. 

The game should be accessable in any browser at "*yourdomain:portnumber*" on a public server, or "*localhost:portnumber*" if run on a local machine.
