How to deploy, run and maintain the TicTacToe project.

This should work on any system using Java JRE 8.

A downloadable zip file containing the binary is available at [Joel&TheJuice github](https://github.com/JoelandtheJuice/TicTacToe/archive/master.zip).

Two ways to start the webserver:

* Simply double click the .jar *tictactoe-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies* located in the TicTacToe/target/ directory or the one you selected when running ./bin/build
* command-line: java -jar tictactoe-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies
